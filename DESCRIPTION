Description: A theoretical model to simulate  radical polymerization. Material, energy and population balances are integrated for batch, semi batch and continuous process in a ideally mixed reactor. Limitations: single monomer (i.e.homo polymer), one phase (organic, aqueous). Datasets with chemical-physical data for the most common monomers is included. Some background in polymer science is suggested for its use. Graphical interface for a quick and friendly use is available.
